To determine if the `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` file is complete for the N3Logic language, particularly in the context of the `n3logic-vscode-extension`, we need to evaluate whether it fully supports the syntax of Notation3 (N3) and N3Logic as handled by the provided `N3LogicParser.ts` and `N3LogicReasoner.cjs.ts`. Additionally, we need to consider the specific extensions and features of N3Logic, such as rules, built-ins, and other constructs, and ensure the language file provides adequate syntax highlighting for them. Since you’ve asked about the completeness of the language file and noted N3Logic extensions, I’ll analyze the provided `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` against the N3Logic syntax and suggest any gaps or improvements.

---

### Analysis of `n3logic.tmLanguage.json`

The `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` file defines the TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting of N3Logic files in VS Code. It includes patterns for various N3 constructs, such as comments, directives, IRIs, prefixed names, variables, literals, and more. Let’s break down the file and evaluate its coverage based on the N3Logic syntax as implemented in `N3LogicParser.ts` and supported by `N3LogicReasoner.cjs.ts`.

#### Supported Constructs in `n3logic.tmLanguage.json`
The language file defines patterns for the following elements:

1. **Comments** (`#comment`):
   - Matches line comments starting with `#` (e.g., `# This is a comment`).
   - Pattern: `#.*$`
   - Scope: `comment.line.number-sign.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Fully supports N3 comments, which are removed by the parser using `/#[^\n]*/g` in `N3LogicParser.ts`.

2. **Directives** (`#directive`):
   - Matches `@prefix` and `@base` directives (e.g., `@prefix ex: <http://example.org/>.`).
   - Pattern: `(@prefix|@base)`
   - Scope: `keyword.other.directive.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Supports standard N3 directives. The parser extracts prefixes using `/@prefix\s+(\w+):\s*<([^>]+)>\s*\./g`, so this is complete for `@prefix`. However, `@base` is not explicitly handled by the parser, which could be a gap if `@base` is used in N3Logic files.

3. **Keywords** (`#keyword`):
   - Matches control keywords: `@forAll`, `@forSome`, `=>`, `<=`.
   - Pattern: `(@forAll|@forSome|=>|<=)`
   - Scope: `keyword.control.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Covers quantifiers (`@forAll`, `@forSome`) and rule implication operators (`=>`, `<=`). The parser handles `=>` for rules (e.g., `{ ?x ex:knows ?y } => { ?y ex:knows ?x }`), but does not explicitly process `@forAll` or `@forSome`. If these quantifiers are critical to N3Logic, the parser may need to be extended, but the language file supports them.

4. **IRIs** (`#iri`):
   - Matches IRIs enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<http://example.org/Alice>`).
   - Pattern: `<[^>]+>`
   - Scope: `constant.language.iri.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Fully supports IRIs, which are parsed by `parseTerm` in `N3LogicParser.ts` when tokens start and end with `<` and `>`.

5. **Prefixed Names** (`#prefixedName`):
   - Matches prefixed names (e.g., `ex:Alice`).
   - Pattern: `[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*:[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*`
   - Scope: `constant.other.prefixed-name.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Matches the parser’s handling of prefixed names, which are expanded using the `prefixMap` in `parseTriples`. The pattern is robust for standard prefixed names.

6. **Blank Nodes** (`#blankNode`):
   - Matches blank nodes (e.g., `_:b1`).
   - Pattern: `_:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`
   - Scope: `constant.other.blank-node.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Fully supports blank nodes, which are parsed by `parseTerm` when tokens start with `_:`. The pattern is sufficient.

7. **Variables** (`#variable`):
   - Matches variables (e.g., `?x`).
   - Pattern: `\?[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
   - Scope: `variable.other.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Fully supports variables, which are parsed by `parseTerm` when tokens start with `?`. The pattern matches the parser’s expectations.

8. **Literals** (`#literal`):
   - Matches triple-quoted strings, double-quoted strings, single-quoted strings, and numeric literals with optional datatype or language tags.
   - Patterns:
     - Triple-quoted: `"""(?:[^\\]|\\.)*?"""(@[a-zA-Z\-]+|\^\^<[^>]+>|\^\^[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*:[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*)?`
     - Double-quoted: `\"(?:[^\\"]|\\.)*\"(@[a-zA-Z\-]+|\^\^<[^>]+>|\^\^[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*:[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*)?`
     - Single-quoted: `'(?:[^\\']|\\.)*'(@[a-zA-Z\-]+|\^\^<[^>]+>|\^\^[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*:[a-zA-Z_][\w\-]*)?`
     - Numeric: `-?\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?\b`
   - Scopes: `string.quoted.triple.n3logic`, `string.quoted.double.n3logic`, `string.quoted.single.n3logic`, `constant.numeric.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Comprehensive for literals, including escaped characters, language tags (e.g., `@en`), and datatypes (e.g., `^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>`). The parser’s `parseTerm` handles these formats, including optional datatype and language tags.

9. **Lists** (`#list`):
   - Matches lists enclosed in parentheses (e.g., `(ex:Alice ex:Bob)`).
   - Pattern: Begins with `\(` and ends with `\)`; includes nested patterns for literals, IRIs, prefixed names, blank nodes, variables, and punctuation.
   - Scope: `meta.structure.list.n3logic`
   - **Coverage**: Fully supports lists, which are parsed by `parseTerm` when tokens start with `(` and end with `)`. The recursive inclusion of other patterns ensures nested elements are highlighted.

10. **Sets** (`#set`):
    - Matches sets (formulas) enclosed in braces (e.g., `{ ?x ex:knows ?y }`).
    - Pattern: Begins with `\{` and ends with `\}`; includes nested patterns for literals, IRIs, prefixed names, blank nodes, variables, and punctuation.
    - Scope: `meta.structure.set.n3logic`
    - **Coverage**: Supports N3Logic formulas, which are critical for rules (e.g., `{ ?x ex:knows ?y } => { ?y ex:knows ?x }`). The parser handles these in `parseRules` and `splitStatements`.

11. **Booleans** (`#boolean`):
    - Matches `true` and `false`.
    - Pattern: `\b(true|false)\b`
    - Scope: `constant.language.boolean.n3logic`
    - **Coverage**: Supports boolean literals, which are parsed as literals by `parseTerm`. The `N3LogicLogicBuiltins.ts` file uses `isRDFTrue` and `isRDFFalse` to handle `true` and `false` as literals, so this is complete.

12. **Punctuation** (`#punctuation`):
    - Matches punctuation: `.`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `;`, `,`.
    - Pattern: `[.{}()\[\];,]`
    - Scope: `punctuation.terminator.n3logic`
    - **Coverage**: Covers all punctuation used in N3, including statement terminators (`.`), list/set delimiters (`{}`, `()`), and triple separators (`;`, `,`). The parser relies on these for splitting statements and triples.

#### N3Logic Extensions
N3Logic extends N3 with features like rules (`{ ... } => { ... }`) and built-ins (e.g., `math:greaterThan`, `string:concatenation`). The provided built-in files (`N3LogicStringBuiltins.ts`, `N3LogicMathBuiltins.ts`, etc.) define URIs like `http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/math#greaterThan`, which appear in N3Logic files as IRIs or prefixed names. The `N3LogicReasoner.cjs.ts` uses these built-ins during reasoning, and the parser handles them as triples with special predicates.

- **Rules**: The `#set` and `#keyword` patterns cover rule syntax (`{ ... } => { ... }`). The parser’s `splitStatements` and `parseRules` methods handle rules robustly, and the language file’s `meta.structure.set.n3logic` scope ensures proper highlighting of rule blocks.
- **Built-ins**: Built-ins are represented as IRIs (e.g., `<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/math#greaterThan>`) or prefixed names (e.g., `math:greaterThan`). The `#iri` and `#prefixedName` patterns cover these. The parser’s `parseBuiltins` method recognizes specific built-in URIs, and the reasoner’s `evaluateBuiltins` applies them. The language file doesn’t need special patterns for built-ins since they’re syntactically identical to other IRIs or prefixed names.
- **Functional Built-ins**: Some built-ins (e.g., `log:call`) are parsed as special triples in `parseRules` (e.g., `log:call(...)`). These are handled by the `#iri` or `#prefixedName` patterns, with arguments in `#list` or as literals/variables.

#### Gaps and Potential Issues
Based on the parser, reasoner, and built-in files, here are potential gaps in `n3logic.tmLanguage.json`:

1. **Support for `@base` Directive**:
   - The language file includes `@base` in the `#directive` pattern, but `N3LogicParser.ts` does not extract or process `@base` directives (only `@prefix` is handled via `extractPrefixes`). If N3Logic files use `@base` to define a base IRI for resolving relative IRIs, the parser needs to be extended, but the language file is complete in this regard.
   - **Recommendation**: If `@base` is used, update `extractPrefixes` to handle it:
     ```typescript
     function extractPrefixes(n3Text: string): Record<string, string> {
       const prefixMap: Record<string, string> = {};
       const prefixRegex = /@prefix\s+(\w+):\s*<([^>]+)>\s*\./g;
       const baseRegex = /@base\s+<([^>]+)>\s*\./g;
       let match;
       while ((match = prefixRegex.exec(n3Text)) !== null) {
         prefixMap[match[1]] = match[2];
       }
       while ((match = baseRegex.exec(n3Text)) !== null) {
         prefixMap[''] = match[1]; // Store base IRI with empty prefix
       }
       return prefixMap;
     }
     ```
     Then, in `parseTerm`, resolve relative IRIs using the base IRI.

2. **Quantifier Support (`@forAll`, `@forSome`)**:
   - The language file supports `@forAll` and `@forSome` as keywords, but the parser does not explicitly process them. If these quantifiers are critical to N3Logic (e.g., for universal or existential quantification in rules), the parser may need to be extended to handle them in `parseRules`.
   - **Recommendation**: If quantifiers are used, add logic to `parseRules` to extract and process `@forAll` and `@forSome`, and ensure the language file’s highlighting is sufficient (it currently is).

3. **Functional Built-in Syntax**:
   - The parser handles functional built-ins like `log:call(...)` and `<uri>(...)` in `parseRules`, treating them as triples with a `List` object. The language file’s `#list` pattern supports the `(...)` syntax, but there’s no specific scope for functional built-ins to distinguish them visually (e.g., `log:call` vs. regular predicates).
   - **Recommendation**: Add a pattern to highlight functional built-ins distinctly:
     ```json
     "functional-builtin": {
       "patterns": [
         {
           "name": "entity.name.function.n3logic",
           "match": "(log:[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*|[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*:[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*|<%[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*>)\\s*\\("
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
     Include this in the main `patterns` array and ensure it has higher precedence than `#iri` or `#prefixedName`.

4. **Numeric Literals with Datatypes**:
   - The `#literal` pattern for numerics (`-?\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?\b`) does not explicitly include datatype annotations (e.g., `42^^xsd:integer`). However, the triple-, double-, and single-quoted string patterns allow `^^<uri>` or `^^prefix:name`, which may cover typed numerics if parsed as strings.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a specific pattern for numeric literals with datatypes:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "constant.numeric.typed.n3logic",
       "match": "-?\\b\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?(?:[eE][+-]?\\d+)?\\b(\\^\\^<[^>]+>|\\^\\^[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*:[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*)"
     }
     ```
     This ensures proper highlighting for numbers with explicit datatypes.

5. **Nested Formulas**:
   - The `#set` pattern supports formulas (e.g., `{ ?x ex:knows ?y }`), but it doesn’t explicitly handle nested formulas (e.g., `{ { ?x ex:knows ?y } => { ?y ex:knows ?x } }`). The parser’s `splitStatements` handles brace depth correctly, so nested formulas are parsed, but highlighting may not distinguish nesting levels.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a recursive pattern for nested sets:
     ```json
     "set": {
       "patterns": [
         {
           "name": "meta.structure.set.n3logic",
           "begin": "\\{",
           "end": "\\}",
           "patterns": [
             { "include": "#set" }, // Recursive include for nested sets
             { "include": "#literal" },
             { "include": "#iri" },
             { "include": "#prefixedName" },
             { "include": "#blankNode" },
             { "include": "#variable" },
             { "include": "#punctuation" }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

6. **Built-in-Specific Patterns**:
   - The built-in files (`N3LogicStringBuiltins.ts`, `N3LogicMathBuiltins.ts`, etc.) define many built-in URIs (e.g., `string:concatenation`, `math:greaterThan`). These are highlighted as `#iri` or `#prefixedName`, but there’s no specific scope to distinguish built-ins from other predicates.
   - **Recommendation**: If visual distinction of built-ins is desired, add a pattern for known built-in namespaces:
     ```json
     "builtin-predicate": {
       "patterns": [
         {
           "name": "entity.name.function.builtin.n3logic",
           "match": "(math|string|log|time|list|type):[a-zA-Z_][\\w\\-]*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
     Include this in the main `patterns` array.

7. **Unicode Support in Identifiers**:
   - The `#prefixedName`, `#variable`, and `#blankNode` patterns restrict identifiers to ASCII characters (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]`). N3 allows Unicode characters in IRIs, prefixed names, and blank nodes.
   - **Recommendation**: Update patterns to support Unicode:
     ```json
     "prefixedName": {
       "patterns": [
         {
           "name": "constant.other.prefixed-name.n3logic",
           "match": "[\\p{L}_][\\p{L}\\p{N}\\-]*:[\\p{L}_][\\p{L}\\p{N}\\-]*"
         }
       ]
     },
     "variable": {
       "patterns": [
         {
           "name": "variable.other.n3logic",
           "match": "\\?[\\p{L}_][\\p{L}\\p{N}_]*"
         }
       ]
     },
     "blankNode": {
       "patterns": [
         {
           "name": "constant.other.blank-node.n3logic",
           "match": "_:[\\p{L}\\p{N}_]+"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
     Use `\p{L}` for Unicode letters and `\p{N}` for numbers.

---

### Is the Language File Complete?

The `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` file is **mostly complete** for standard N3 and N3Logic syntax, covering comments, directives, keywords, IRIs, prefixed names, blank nodes, variables, literals, lists, sets, booleans, and punctuation. It aligns well with the parsing logic in `N3LogicParser.ts` and supports the constructs used by `N3LogicReasoner.cjs.ts`, including rules and built-ins. However, there are areas for improvement to ensure full coverage of N3Logic extensions and edge cases:

1. **Complete for Core N3 Syntax**: The file fully supports triples, prefixes, literals, lists, and blank nodes, which are the core of N3.
2. **Complete for N3Logic Rules**: The `#set` and `#keyword` patterns cover rule syntax (`{ ... } => { ... }`).
3. **Mostly Complete for Built-ins**: Built-ins are highlighted as IRIs or prefixed names, but lack specific scoping for visual distinction.
4. **Incomplete for Edge Cases**:
   - `@base` directive is supported in highlighting but not in the parser.
   - Quantifiers (`@forAll`, `@forSome`) are highlighted but not fully processed by the parser.
   - Nested formulas need recursive pattern support.
   - Numeric literals with datatypes could use a specific pattern.
   - Unicode support in identifiers is missing.
   - Functional built-in syntax (e.g., `log:call(...)`) could be highlighted distinctly.

---

### Recommendations for Completeness

To make the language file fully complete for N3Logic and its extensions, apply the following updates to `n3logic.tmLanguage.json`:

1. **Add Support for Nested Formulas**:
   Update the `#set` pattern to include recursive `#set` inclusion (see above).

2. **Add Specific Patterns for Built-ins**:
   Add a `#builtin-predicate` pattern to highlight known built-in namespaces (e.g., `math:`, `string:`) distinctly.

3. **Add Functional Built-in Pattern**:
   Add a `#functional-builtin` pattern to highlight `log:call(...)` and similar constructs.

4. **Add Numeric Literal with Datatype**:
   Add a pattern for typed numeric literals (e.g., `42^^xsd:integer`).

5. **Add Unicode Support**:
   Update `#prefixedName`, `#variable`, and `#blankNode` patterns to use `\p{L}` and `\p{N}`.

6. **Verify `@base` and Quantifier Usage**:
   - If `@base` is used in your N3Logic files, ensure the parser handles it (see above).
   - If `@forAll` or `@forSome` are critical, extend `parseRules` to process them and verify highlighting.

Here’s an updated `patterns` section incorporating these recommendations:

  // ... other patterns ...
}
```

### Testing for Completeness

To verify the updated language file, test it with a comprehensive N3Logic file that includes all supported constructs:

```n3
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/>.
@prefix math: <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/math#>.
@base <http://example.org/>.

# Comment
@forAll ?x, ?y.
{ ?x ex:knows ?y } => { ?y ex:knows ?x }.
ex:Alice ex:knows ex:Bob.
math:greaterThan(?x, 5).
log:call("test", "arg1", "arg2").
{ ex:Alice ex:age "42"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> }.
_:b1 ex:name "Alice"@en.
(ex:Alice ex:Bob)
{ { ?x ex:knows ?y } => { ?y ex:friend ?x } }.
```

- **Steps**:
  1. Update `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` with the recommended changes.
  2. Place it in `n3logic-vscode-extension/syntaxes/`.
  3. Reload the extension in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P > Developer: Reload Window`).
  4. Open the test file and verify that all elements (prefixes, rules, built-ins, literals, nested formulas, etc.) are highlighted correctly.
  5. Enable debug logging in `N3LogicParser.ts` (`parser.setDebug(true)`) and check the Output panel for parsing errors.

---

### Addressing VS Code Extension Issues

Since you mentioned problems with the `n3logic-vscode-extension`, the language file’s completeness is only part of the solution. The parser and reasoner must also handle all constructs highlighted by the language file. Based on the provided files:

- **Parser (`N3LogicParser.ts`)**: Handles most constructs but lacks `@base` and quantifier support. Update as recommended if needed.
- **Reasoner (`N3LogicReasoner.cjs.ts`)**: Supports rules and built-ins via `evaluateBuiltins` and `matchFormula`. Ensure all built-ins from `N3Logic*Builtins.ts` files are registered using `registerBuiltin`.
- **Extension Integration**: Verify that `package.json` references `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` correctly and that the extension registers language providers for diagnostics or completions if needed.

If you’re encountering specific errors (e.g., syntax highlighting not working, parsing failures), please share:
- The error message or behavior.
- A sample N3Logic file causing the issue.
- Debug logs from `N3LogicParser.ts` or `N3LogicReasoner.cjs.ts`.

This will help pinpoint whether the issue is with the language file, parser, reasoner, or extension configuration.

---

### Further Enhancements and Recommendations

In addition to the above, consider the following enhancements to make the N3Logic grammar and extension even more robust and user-friendly:

1. **Error/Invalid Highlighting**
  - Add a pattern for common syntax errors (e.g., unclosed strings, unmatched braces, invalid tokens) to visually flag mistakes in the editor. This helps users spot issues before running the parser.

2. **Custom Data Types and Language Tags**
  - If your N3Logic usage includes custom datatypes or language tags, consider patterns to highlight these distinctly, or at least ensure they are not mis-highlighted as errors.

3. **Multi-line and Embedded Content**
  - If N3Logic files can contain multi-line literals or embedded content (e.g., JSON, XML), consider patterns for these cases, or document any known limitations.

4. **Semantic Token Support**
  - For richer highlighting, consider adding a semantic token provider (in addition to TextMate grammar) if you plan to support features like go-to-definition, find references, or symbol navigation in the future.

5. **Integration with Linting/Diagnostics**
  - Document or plan for integration with a linter or diagnostics provider, so that users get real-time feedback on both syntax and semantic errors.

6. **Extensibility for Future N3Logic Features**
  - Add a section to your documentation about how to extend the grammar and parser when new N3Logic features or built-ins are added, including a checklist for updating both the grammar and the parser.

7. **User/Contributor Guidance**
  - Provide a quick reference or FAQ for users and contributors, e.g., "What to do if highlighting is broken?", "How to add a new built-in?", "How to test grammar changes?".

8. **Automated Testing for Grammar**
  - Consider setting up automated tests for the grammar file itself (e.g., using the VS Code TextMate grammar test suite) to catch regressions in highlighting.

### Conclusion

The `n3logic.tmLanguage.json` file is **nearly complete** for N3Logic, covering core N3 syntax and N3Logic extensions like rules and built-ins. However, adding patterns for nested formulas, functional built-ins, typed numerics, Unicode identifiers, and specific built-in predicates will make it fully robust. The parser and reasoner align well with the language file but may need updates for `@base` and quantifiers if used. Apply the recommended changes, test with a comprehensive N3Logic file, and share any specific issues for further assistance.
