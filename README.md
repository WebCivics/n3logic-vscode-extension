# N3Logic VSCode Extension

This is the subfolder for the VS Code extension implementation, including semantic token support for N3Logic files.

- Entry point: `extension.ts`
- Build: `npm run compile`
- Language: TypeScript

## Next Steps
- Implement a semantic tokens provider in `extension.ts`.
- Register it for the `n3logic` language.
- Map N3Logic constructs to semantic token types.
